# Technical Debt

## What is Technical Debt

Technical debt, in software development, is like a credit card for your codebase: you can take shortcuts to deliver features quickly, but you'll have to pay it back later with interest. 

Technical debt refers to the future costs associated with relying on shortcuts or suboptimal decisions made during software development.

This can involve opting for the quickest solution rather than the most efficient or robust one, usually to meet deadlines or deliver features faster.

It's a metaphor for the additional rework required to bring a software system to its ideal state after taking these shortcuts. 

## Why has it happened in this project

Tech debt occurs for several reasons. And not necessarily bad reasons. Here is why it happened in this project:

1. Due to poor time management, things were rushed to get it working
2. Nolan was working on this at 3am
3. Nolan was very tired at 3am
4. Nobody peer reviewed Nolan's code, leading to bad code
5. No automated testing means the project is brittle and breaks often
6. I didn't know the ideal way to solve a problem, so I chose the first solution that worked

"The worst code you write, is the code you wrote five minutes ago" - A smart guy
"Your goal should be to write code that doesn't lead to the next dev hunting you down with an axe" - Another smart guy
"All code is garbage" - A very smart guy

## What this means for you?

Tech debt is riddled throughout "most" proffessional projects, learning to work in an older project with tech debt is an essential skill, and often harder then building net-new projects. This makes working in this project essential to preparing you to real-world projects.

There is a lot of opportunity to discover new/better ways to solve issues in this project for you. There is in general, a lot of work to be done in just improving the quality of the existing projects.
